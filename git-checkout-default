# Description:
# ------------
# The git-checkout-default script automatically checks out the default branch of
# the current Git repository, regardless of its name. It works in repositories
# where the default branch may be main, master, or any custom branch.
#
# The script first verifies that the current directory is a Git repository,
# determines the default branch from the remote origin, fetches the latest
# changes, and then switches to that branch.
#
# This ensures the local repository is aligned with the remote default branch
# without requiring manual specification of the branch name.
