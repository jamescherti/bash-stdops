# bash-stdops - A collection of Bash helper scripts that facilitate operations
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jamescherti/bash-stdops)

The `bash-stdops` project is a collection of helpful Bash scripts, written by [James Cherti](https://www.jamescherti.com/), that simplify various operations, including file searching, text replacement, and content modification.

The author uses these scripts in conjunction with text editors like Emacs and Vim to automate tasks, including managing Tmux sessions, replacing text across a Git repository, securely copying and pasting from the clipboard by prompting the user before executing commands in Tmux, fix permissions, among other operations.

## Install bash-stdops scripts

### System-wide installation

To install `bash-stdops` scripts system-wide, use the following command:
```bash
sudo make install
```

### Alternative installation: Install in your home directory

If you prefer to install the scripts locally in your home directory, you can use the `~/.local/bin` directory. This method avoids requiring administrative privileges and keeps the installation isolated to your user environment.

Use the following command to install the scripts into the `~/.local/bin` directory:

```bash
PREFIX=~/.local make install
```

Ensure that `~/.local/bin` is included in your `$PATH` by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

## Scripts

### Script category: tmux

#### Script: tmux-cbpaste

The `tmux-cbpaste`: script enables pasting clipboard content into the current `tmux` window. It ensures safety by requiring user confirmation before pasting, preventing accidental insertion of data.

#### Script: tmux-run

This script executes a command in a new `tmux` window, which functions similarly to a tab in other applications.

- If run within an existing `tmux` session, it creates a new window in the same session.
- If run outside of `tmux`, it creates a new window in the first available `tmux` session.
- If the environment variable `TMUX_RUN_SESSION_NAME` is set, the script will create the new window in the specified `tmux` session.

Usage:
```
  tmux-run <command> [args...]
```

Example:
```
tmux-run bash
```

Example 2:
```
tmux-run bash -c htop
```

#### Script: tmux-session

The `tmux-session` script attempts to attach to an existing `tmux` session. If the session does not exist, it creates a new session with that name.

If no session name is provided, it defaults to creating or attaching to a session named "0".

### Script category: files, paths, and strings

#### Script: walk

The `walk` bash script recursively search the specified directory and print the list of file or directory paths to standard output.

#### Script: walk-run

Recursively execute a command on all files listed by the `rg --files` command. For example, to recursively `cat` all text files in `/etc`, use the following command:
```
walk-run /etc cat {}
```

(`{}` is replaced with the path to each file.)

Here is an example of how you can combine `walk-run` and `sed` to replace "Text1" with "Text2" in a Git repository:
```
walk-run /path/to/git-repository/ sed -i -e "s/Text1/Text2/g" {}
```

#### Script: sre

The `sre` script replaces occurrences of a specified string or regular expression pattern with support for exact string matching, regular expressions, and case-insensitive matching. Unlike `sed`, which uses a single argument for replacements, this script allows specifying the text-to-find and text-to-replace as two distinct arguments.

To replace text in the standard input and output the result to the standard output:
```
echo "text-before" | sre "text-before" "text-after"
```

To replace text directly in a file (overwriting the file):
```
sre "text-before" "text-after" file
```

Here are the `sre` options:
```
Usage: sre [-ierdh] <string-before> <string-after>

  -i    Ignore case when comparing files
  -e    Use regular expressions instead of exact strings.
  -r    Use extended regular expressions.
  -d    Show the sed command
  -h    Show this help message and exit
```

Here is an example of how you can combine `walk-run` and `sre` to replace `Text1` with `Text2` in a Git repository:
```
walk-run /path/to/git-repository/ sre Text1 Text2 {}
```

#### Script: git-sre

Execute `sre` at the root directory of a Git repository.

(The `sre` script replaces occurrences of a specified string or regular expression pattern with support for exact string matching, regular expressions, and case-insensitive matching.)

Example usage:
```
git sre TextBefore TextAfter /path/to/git/repo
```

(sre also supports regular expressions.)

#### Scripts: path-tr, path-uppercase, path-lowercase

- `path-tr`: This script processes a given file path, extracts the directory and filename, converts the filename using the specified `tr` options (e.g., to lowercase), and prints the modified full path. Example usage: `path-tr /Path/TO/FILE '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` This will convert the filename to lowercase, producing: `/Path/TO/file`.

- `path-uppercase`: This script processes a given file path, extracts the directory and filename, converts the filename to uppercase. Example usage: `path-uppercase /Path/TO/FILE` This will convert the filename to uppercase, producing: `/Path/to/FILE`.

- `path-lowercase`: This script processes a given file path, extracts the directory and filename, converts the filename to lowercase. Example usage: `path-lowercase /Path/TO/FILE`. This will convert the filename to lowercase, producing: `/Path/TO/file`.

#### Script: autoperm

This script sets permissions for files or directories:
- If it's a directory: 755
- If it's a file with a shebang (e.g., "#!/bin/bash"): 755
- If it's a file: 644

Usage:
```
autoperm /path/to/file-or-directory
```

#### Script: path-is

Print the Path to stdout and exit with the code 0 if it is a binary or text file.

Example usage:
``` bash
path-is /Path/TO/FILE binary
path-is /Path/TO/FILE text
```

### Script category: git

#### git-dcommit

Script to automate common Git commit tasks:
- Automatically add untracked files (prompted),
- Display git diff to the user before committing,
- Commit changes to the Git repository,
- Optionally reuse the previous Git commit message if available.

Usage:
```
./script_name.sh
```

Run this script from within a Git repository to automate adding, reviewing, and committing changes.

#### git-squash

A script to squash new Git commits between the current branch and a specified branch.

```
Usage:
  ./script_name.sh <other-git-branch>
```

Features:
- Compares the current branch with the specified branch.
- Displays a summary of new commits to be squashed.
- Prompts for confirmation if there are more than 4 commits.
- Automatically squashes all new commits into one, retaining the message of
  the first commit.


### Script category: ssh

#### Script: esa

Esa (Easy SSH Agent) simplifies starting ssh-agent, adding keys with ssh-add, and executing commands using the agent.

Usage:
```
Usage: esa <start|stop|ssh-add|exec>

start: Starts the ssh agent
start: Stop the ssh agent
add: Adds private keys requiring a password with ssh-add
exec: Executes a program using this agent
env: Displays the ssh-agent environment variables
```

#### Script: sshwait

This script repeatedly attempts to check the availability of the SSH server on the host provided as the first argument. It exits with a 0 status upon successfully establishing a connection at least once. Note that it only verifies if the SSH server is reachable and does not provide a shell prompt or execute any commands on the remote host.

Usage:
```
./script_name.sh <host>
```

### X11/Wayland scripts

#### xocrshot

The xocrshot script captures a screenshot using 'scrot', performs optical character recognition (OCR) using 'tesseract' command, and:
- Displays the extracted text in the terminal
- Copies it to the clipboard.

Features:
- Captures a screenshot using the 'scrot' command,
- Performs OCR on the screenshot using Tesseract,
- Displays the extracted text in the terminal,
- Copies the extracted text to the clipboard using 'xclip',
- Provides error handling and cleanup of temporary files,
- Supports notifications using 'notify-send' (if available).

Usage:
``` bash
xocrshot
```

### Script category: Misc

#### Script: haide

The haide script utilizes AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) to monitor the file integrity of the user's home directory, ensuring no files are modified, added, or deleted without the user's knowledge. Key functions handle database setup, integrity checks, and user-approved updates. The script filters non-critical changes, ensuring meaningful alerts while maintaining a secure and reliable monitoring process.

#### Scripts: cbcopy, cbpaste

- `cbcopy`: This script copies the content of stdin to the clipboard.
- `cbpaste`: This script reads the contents of the system clipboard and writes it to stdout.
- `cbwatch`: Monitor the clipboard and display its content when it changes.

#### Script: outonerror

The `outonerror` script redirects the command's output to stderr only if the command fails (non-zero exit code). No output is shown when the command succeeds.

Here is an example of how to use this script: [How to make cron notify the user about a failed command by redirecting its output to stderr only when it fails (non-zero exit code)](https://www.jamescherti.com/cron-email-output-failed-commands-only/).

#### Script: over

This program simply displays a notification. It can be used in the terminal while another command is running. Once the command finishes executing, a notification is displayed, informing the user that the process has completed.

#### Script: largs

This script reads from standard input and executes a command for each line, replacing `{}` with the content read from stdin. It expects `{}` to be passed as one of the arguments and will fail if `{}` is not provided.

This script is an alternative to xargs.
``` bash
{ echo "file1"; echo "file2"; } | largs ls {}
```

#### Script: xargs-loop

The `xargs-loop` script processes lines from standard input, executing a specified command for each line and replacing `{}` in the command with the current line of input. This provides flexibility by using `{}` as a placeholder, similar to `xargs -I {}`, but with the ability to handle each line individually. Unlike `xargs`, which has mutually exclusive `-L 1` and `-I {}` options, `xargs-loop` combines the benefits of both by enabling placeholder substitution and line-by-line processing.

Usage:
```
cat input_file | xargs-loop command '{}'
```

Options:
- The script reads lines from stdin and replaces '{}' with each line in the command.
- The script exits with status 1 if the command does not include '{}' or if any command execution fails.
