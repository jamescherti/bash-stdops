# Description:
# ------------
# This script modifies the file name of the path using the 'tr' command.
#
# It processes a given file path, extracts the directory and filename, converts
# the filename using the specified `tr` options (e.g., to lowercase), and prints
# the modified full path.
#
# Example usage:
#   path-tr /Path/TO/FILE '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
#   This will convert the filename to lowercase, producing: /Path/TO/file
